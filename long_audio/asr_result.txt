 Now I'd like to start this evening by introducing someone who couldn't be here with us last weekend who is the co-director for this course. And that's Dr. Sherry Renn. Who's right here. Dr. Renn is well deserving of your applause. She is a currently a professor of surgery, an expert in oncologic surgery and chief of surgery at the VA hospital, of course, which is affiliated with Stanford Medical School. But beyond that, she is a person of really quite significant renown in education. She's one virtually every teaching award that we've given. She served as the director of the medical senate, which is really quite an esteemed role. And she's also nationally recognized for her work in surgery as a governor of the American College of Surgeons. And this year became an associate dean in academic affairs. So we're really pleased to have Sherry with us for the chorus. Thank you, Sherry. And because this course has become so popular, our speaker for next week, Jill Helms, Jill why don't you stand up? She couldn't wait to be here. In fact, she asked whether she could go first tonight but I told her no she'd have to way to next week because we're going to drill down tonight even to smaller entities than which he's going to speak about next week. She'll talk about the fascinating area of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine. But tonight we're going right down to the molecular basis of life. This is a really important topic, one that has certainly changed as I indicated to you last week in just such remarkable ways over the last 40 to 50 years, really with some of the most fundamental work taking place here at Stanford. Just to remind you of what I said last week that began when the school was really founded here in 1959 with Arthur Cornberg's seminal investigations. He won the Nobel Prize for his work and just two years ago his son, Roger Cornberg, also won the Nobel Prize to kind of book in that family and really catalog some of the extraordinary work in the study of DNA and its transcription. And as we think about the future of our topics tonight's session will be really I think quite essential for your knowledge base. Now our speaker tonight, Professor Gilchew, has an interesting history in his entree in medicine. He started out at Princeton University where he was an extraordinary student in physics. Actually went on and got his PhD in physics at MIT. And then a light went off and he said, I think I'd like to be a doctor. So he then went to Harvard Medical School where he completed his MD degree, trained in internal medicine at the mass general, one of the most distinguished hospitals in the nation, and then elected to move into the area of oncology, came to Stanford to do his fellowship in medical oncology, joined the faculty, and has had a remarkably distinguished career since then, both as a professor of medicine and as a professor of biochemistry. He works in the area of DNA repair, damage related to both ionizer radiation, ultraviolet light, which may sound ethereal, but is actually related to some disorders that fall into my own world of pediatric oncology, where risks for UV light damage can actually lead to certain volignancies. So he is someone who's leading the edge, if you will, and fundamental new knowledge. And beyond that has also been one of our most distinguished teachers. He is the person who leads the learning curve of our new medical students and the foundations of molecular medicine. So I'm really pleased to have this evening for you and with you, Dr. Gilchew. So thank you, Phil, for that very nice introduction. We have a lot to cover. The three hours we're going to do tonight. Usually that takes six years in elementary school. And I'm going to try to do it in less than an hour so that I can get into applications of the three hours. Because you don't want to just learn about the three hours. And we're going to go all the way from molecules to medicine. This is in bronodotorium. That's the periodic table. And I've got my molecules here and my periodic table here. So if you forget, I'm wearing tie. So the way this talk is organized, and I don't think there's a laser pointer, but I may not really need it, but it's okay. Three R's are replication, recombination and repair, and I'll tell you about them. And then I'll tell you about a couple of very short applications using recombinant DNA and new drugs. And then implications, implications of the 3Rs, the application of the technology to new drugs, and implications that has for our health care system, which you've probably heard a lot about lately. So we're going to go right into the 3Rs, replication, copies DNA, recombination to rearrange his DNA, and repair fixes DNA. And I'm going to start talking about some complicated things, but I just want you to know what replication does is it, like on a Starship Enterprise, that replicated food, and what replication does is it makes an exact copy of DNA just as on the Starship Enterprise. Now, when we start getting more complicated, don't hesitate to raise your hand and interrupt me, because if I skip the step, I don't want to keep moving on. I want you to interrupt me and ask a question, okay? If you have a philosophical question, we can wait till the end. Okay. All right. Now, Phil mentioned Arthur Cornberg, so here's a picture of Arthur. He actually founded one of my two departments, the Biochemistry Department, by bringing it lock, stock, and barrel from St. Louis. And in 1957, he was able to reconstitute the process of DNA replication in a test tube. The headlines at the time says, said, Professor reproduces life in the test tube. Not quite right, but he reproduced a really key step in life. And he found that the reaction only required a few components which I've listed here in red. A DNA polymerase, which copies the DNA, A template DNA, which is the DNA 2B copied, primer DNA to get the DNA polymerase started just the way you prime a pump. That's why it's called primer DNA. And nucleotide bases, which are incorporated into the DNA, and you all know that there are four bases, which are basically the code for life. And how they're organized in the DNA tells the cell on what proteins to make and how to make them. All right. So basically what you have is you start out with a DNA molecule. And if the cell wants to divide, it has to make a new copy. And this is an electron microscopic image of the replication of the E. coli genome. E. coli, there are more genomes of E. coli in you than your own genome because there are gazillion E. coli sitting in your gut. And so they're very handy. We don't have to dig very far to find them. And that DNA is being replicated, and these things are replication forks, which are marked by those arrows. And those are the areas in which new DNA is being synthesized. And those forks are moving outward until you finally end up with two circles. And then the two circles will go into two daughter E. coli bacterium, bacteria when it divides. Same thing with yourselves. So here's where it gets a little complicated, but I need to give you a little bit of a picture because I have to show you the replication fork in order to show you some of the applications later. So replication differs. There are two strands of DNA. It forms a double helix. And the DNA actually has a directionality to it. And we call it five prime to three prime. So you'll notice that the DNA molecules are antipyralyl to each other. They each have a 5 prime to 3 prime direction, but the two DNA strands are going in opposite directions. So the 5 prime and 3 prime ends of the two molecules are next to each other up there. All right? Now, it turns out DNA polymerase is kind of dumb. It only goes in one direction, 5 prime to 3 prime. It doesn't go backwards. There are actually very deep reasons, probably, that why it doesn't go backwards. But it's very important for it not to go backwards. Now, since the two DNA strands are anti-parallel, if you're going to copy that DNA at a replication fork, one of the strands is very easy because on the upper strand, you're copying the yellow DNA into new red DNA. And because you're copying it in an antiparralal direction, the DNA, that's being synthesized, is going 5 prime to 3 prime opposite to the template DNA strand, the old DNA strand. So that polymerase keeps going in a continuous way and then displaces the replication fork to the left. On the other hand, so from the left hand picture to the right hand picture, you can see the replication fork moving to the left. My left, you're right, OK? Going that way. All right. Now, because the replication fork is going that away, and because the lagging strand, the other strand of DNA, is in the antiparial direction, and because DNA polymerase can only go 5 prime to 3 prime, it can only go backwards away from the replication fork. So what it does is it goes backwards for a little bit, And then it hops towards their application fork and goes backwards again, creating very short fragments which were discovered by a molecular biologist in Japan named Okazaki, so they're called short Okazaki fragments. And because it's going backwards, each of those Okazaki fragments can then be synthesized to meet. So on the lagging strand, an Okazaki fragment gets synthesized until it bumps into the previous Okazaki fragment. And then a ligase, a DNA ligase joins the two DNA ends. Are you with me so far? Uh-huh. OK, so yeah, go ahead. If it has two sides of five prime and a three prime, if it's taking a one that's going from three prime to five prime, making one that's five prime to three prime, is making it backwards. That's right. How is it replicating things that hasn't gotten to you yet? It's not. It's only going to get to, so in the top strand, that one's easy, right? That's going five prime to three prime. And you notice that the new DNA that's being synthesized will therefore be anti-parallel to the DNA it's copying. So the red strand on the upper fork is going in the opposite direction from the yellow strand on the upper fork. And that's going to keep going, displacing the fork. So the fork is going to get displaced and unwound. It's the same basis, but the same the other way. OK, so the question is, is it the same basis, but facing the up other way? It's quote, copying the DNA, but it's not copying it as an exact copy. What it's doing is, every time it sees the base A, it puts in a T, every time it sees the base G, it puts in a C. So it puts in what's called a complementary base. A's and T's are complementary to each other. G's and C's are complementary to each other. So the code is actually got a code of GCAT, but the other strand has a code that's kind of the bizarro mirror image of it. It's not the exact image, but it's a complementary image. Did you ever read Superman comics? So Superman was the night for all good, but there was a bizarro world, which was a copy of Superman's world. And there was a bizarro Superman who kind of looked like Superman, but wasn't quite the same. That's what this is. You're putting in complimentary bases of DNA. So since you're always putting in the complimentary bases of DNA, when you copy that other strand again, you just put in the complement to the complement, which restores the old strand. So as long as you're putting in the compliment each time, you've always got all the information there. Ooh, thank you. Is that, are you okay with that? Yeah, the superman thing. The superman thing worth. Okay. Uh-huh. Is there, if there's just one polymerase molecule that's second care of both of these strands or is there like a seed these things, flow through? No, no, actually there's a big machine called the replicome. And actually, how many people hear so? Mostly women, I'm looking not a whole lot of men are raising their hands. But the way a sewing machine works is this strand is working like a sewing machine. So it's going backwards, and then it goes this way, and then goes this way, just like a sewing machine. So there's a polymerase that's doing this job, and there's another polymerase that's doing that job. But they're all part of a big machine. So the whole thing is being held together right this fork and then this fork is moving. Is that okay? Okay, yeah. I forgot to repeat the question, but let me try to read. What's the length of the fragments in which it works? Yeah, no, this leading strand, the question was how long does it do the replication? Yeah, on the leading strand, on the lagging strand, okay, so I'll start on the leading strand. The leading strand is really long, it just goes and goes and goes, okay. In fact, there's a sliding clamp that keeps it on, and the sliding clamp looks like a clamp, it's like a circle. On the lagging strand, what it'll do is it'll, depending on the, what organism you are, if you're a bacterium or a human, it's slightly different. So it's a few hundred to many hundreds of, of bases. So like a sewing machine, the length of the stitch depends on the species, but it's fairly short, a few hundred. Just to give you an idea, the human genome has six billion base, base pairs. So it's just little snippets. Uh-huh. We're okay. Uh-huh. So at what point when it comes, I guess we've constantly settled how long will it be before it actually becomes just like a problem? Two molecules. Yeah. So in E. coli, in the back here in our guts, they can divide in about 20 minutes. Takes us a little longer. It takes us a little longer. So the question was, how long does this process take? And an E. coli can do it. their DNA genome is only 5 million base pairs. They start at one spot and they go. We've got 23 chromosomes, so we obviously are 46. But every chromosome starts independently, but because our genome is so large, we actually initiate replication at many spots on each chromosome. So we can get the job done in a reasonable amount of time. OK. So let's move on. That was pretty tough, actually. I think I'm hoping that's the toughest. Okay. Now, I've tried to make it simple. We're moving on to recombination. That rearranges the DNA. So those of you who don't know what rearrangement is, you remember Mr. Potato Head. And this is Mr. Potato Head Optimash Prime. Do you watch those kind of movies? My teenage son does. But anyway, Transformers. OK, OK, so anyway. Now, Optimized Prime, you've got a mustache here. I don't know what this is. Some kind of a nose. A different thing for the arms. I don't know. Maybe a beard? I don't know. But you can make all kinds of Mr. Potato heads. And DNA recombination is a way of rearranging the DNA to make new pieces. It turns out that kind of stuff is going on all the time. You probably thought that you were born with a fixed complement of DNA and your future was set. But I want to disabuse you of that notion. You are actually being bombarded by changes all the time. Your DNA is constantly influxed by this Mr. Potato Head like system. So you need to hear about recombination. OK? Now, there are two types of recombination. And one is called homologous recombination. No, this is going to be a hard one. Homologous recombination. But we'll get you through it. And the other one is site-specific recombination. So here goes. Watch homologous recombination. It's a mess. First of all, I have to tell you what the word homologous means. DNA molecules are homologous if they have similar DNA sequences. Two identical twins, when they're born before mutations occur and before all kinds of recombination occurs, are 100% homologous. That's what an identical twin is. Certainly, in utero, there are 100% homologous. Now, men and women are 97% homologous. Chimps and humans, male chimps. And a male human are 97% homologous. So, that explains a lot. But I think you've got the concept. They're pretty similar, but there's some important differences. Okay. All right. Now, this is the hard thing. Huh. What a mess that is. But homologous recombination repairs DNA double strand breaks. So I started out with two DNA molecules that were intact. One was a double strand of DNA molecule that was yellow, and one was a double strand of DNA molecule that was red. Now the yellow molecule developed a double strand break. Now a double strand break is a disaster because that's a broken chromosome and the cell will die unless it can fix it. So what homologous recombination does is the yellow DNA, double-stranded DNA molecule, was the broken one, right? And so what it does is, when it's broken, what often happens is some of the stuff at the ends gets all screwed up, okay? And in fact, the information gets messed up. So what it does is it says, aha, I can find, if I can find a nearby DNA molecule that's homologous, I will use that to do my repair. Okay? So what it does is it does something called strand invasion. It takes the three prime. Remember I told you about five prime and three prime ends? Ooh. It takes the three prime end of this DNA molecule and it invades the homologous DNA. Now remember the DNA molecules, the two DNA strands were complementary to each other. So they will actually hybridize to each other by hydrogen bonding. OK? Say what hybridize means. Hybridize means that the two DNA molecules will stick together, because it turns out that there are nice hydrogen bonds between the G nucleotide and the C nucleotide that cause them to hydrogen bond and stick together. And there are hydrogen bonds between A and T nucleotides that cause them to stick. So the DNA molecules will actually zip up because the complementary bases want to stick together via hydrogen bonds. That guy. I can't teach you all of chemistry, but I think you remember some of that. These are not covalent bonds, but there are bonds that nevertheless will cause two molecules to stick together. So each double-stranded DNA molecule wants to stick to itself. But under the conditions of homologous recombination, you displace one of the strands to allow this broken DNA molecule to strand invade. Once it strands invades, then DNA polymerase, remember that guy can actually copy this DNA. So if the double strand break was created, where you lost a few bases at the ends, OK? you can recover them by copying the missing bases off of the other DNA strand. Now, I'm not real good at fixing things unless I have a copy to work from. So when I start doing plumbing, and I forgot how I mess things up, I go to the other bathroom, and I check it out, and then I copy what happened. I've got a bathroom in the house with two sinks right next to each other. That's very handy. So this is what's going on here. OK. Then, after you do this, the other side of the break, the other side of the break actually can copy off of the display strand. All right? This, then, what you can do is you can hop back and you get something called a double holiday junction, which you'll notice has two Ls in it, so it's not a vacation. It's named after a British biologist, Robin Holiday. And what happens is these junctions actually get resolved by nicking the DNA in either one of two ways. And the DNA strands are cut at the arrows. And then you end up with two intact chromosomes, chromosomes with something called crossover and something without. Now, you don't have to remember that for later. But you end up now either depending on how you cut the DNA, it doesn't really matter. You end up with two intact chromosomes. Now, some information, quote, has been exchanged. So if you're copying a DNA molecule that's 99% the same, you'll copy the mistakes, the 1% of the mistakes. OK, you OK with this? I think this is the second hardest slide. Questions? If you already had the first part? Yeah, you did. I think getting started is the hardest. What causes the strand break the first place? What causes this strand break in the first place is the question, just being alive. All the time, you're making oxygen-free radicals while you're metabolizing. You're at body temperature right now, and oxygen-free radicals are coming in, and they are making strand breaks in your DNA. And when they make two strand breaks that are near each other, your DNA falls apart. The other thing is cosmic rays are coming in and getting you. Or you went to the dentist. I went to the dentist yesterday, and he wanted 14 x-rays. Bang! X-rays are especially good at making double strand breaks. So just being around causes this to happen. So this better be working or you're in trouble. Uh-huh. It's only ionizing radiation that does that. And RF energy creates radiation. Well, in terms of the electromagnetic spectrum, you actually need enough energy, high enough energy, and tuned enough to break the strands of DNA. Ultraviolet radiation, for example, will not do it. Ionizing radiation is tuned just right to break it. But there are other things that do it. plants, for example, make a lot of poisons. And they have drugs that will actually create double strand breaks. In oncology, we harvest those drugs and give them to our patients, not because we don't like our patients, but because they happen to kill cancer cells just a little bit before they kill the patient. And so they have some benefit for cancer chemotherapy. And some of our most important cancer chemotherapy drugs make double strand breaks. So lots of ways of making double strand breaks. It turns out your immune system in order to generate immunological diversity makes double strand breaks on purpose to generate huge numbers of different kinds of antibodies. So this is just happening. Uh-huh. Where's the spare DNA come from that it's dragged onto? Ah, where's the spare DNA come from? This process only operates, only operates during replication. Where did the spare DNA come from? All I have to do is go back to the replication fork because we spent so much time on this. If there's a double strand break over here, there's the spare DNA right on the other side of the replication fork. Now you're gonna ask me another question. What's the other question? Remember, this is always happening. When replication ain't going on, right? When replication isn't going on, There is another machinery that actually repairs the brakes, which I'm not going to tell you about. It happens to be what I dearly love, because it's one of the things I spend all my time thinking about in the laboratory. But I'll spare you the pain. It's actually quite simple. It just jams the DNA ends together. And if it doesn't work, you don't have an immune system. So a great question. OK. Any other questions? I think most of you are coming along. Do you understand the questions? OK, yeah. No, what is sure that the proper DNA of Jews may prepare? Yeah. Well, what happens is this only happens during replication, right? And the strand invasion only occurs between homologous DNA strands. What percentage homology do you have to have? Ooh, what percentage homology do you have to have? It's got to be at least 95% or so. Otherwise, it gets, it's shades of gray. If it's 100% homology, the strand invasion is very efficient. If it's 98%, it's pretty efficient. I think, you know, somewhere around 90% it just doesn't happen very often. But you're asking a really good question because maybe there's some place else on this newly replicated DNA that it could hop over to. And sometimes it does. And when it does, you could have a deletion. So think mistakes happen. Mistakes happen. That's why you're, he's worried about errors. He's asking, you know, how homologous do they have to be? Right. Very good. Now replication occurs. Replication occurs with very high fidelity. one error in 10 to the seven basis. So if you do homologous recombination right here at the replication fork, very few errors. But it turns out that homologous recombination also operates during meiosis when you're making egg and sperm. And there it occurs between different chromosomes. And there's where we get all the diversity I see in front of me. Although, I don't think you're as diverse as our medical school class. No, you're definitely not. But we'll work on that. OK. But this thing can operate when it's not precise. And there's a special machinery for making it work during myosis. OK. So we're good with this. Now, yes. The replication machine has an A and needs to make a C, is it on the other? It happens to be a T, but it's not important. Yeah. Create a T? Or does it find a T? Yeah. Yeah. So the question was, what about this replication machine? It's coming along and it sees an A and it needs to copy the A. And the A is going to be copied into a T. But remember what Arthur Cormburg did? He found out that you have to have A's, T's, G's, and C's into the reaction. So those things are just floating around in the cell. And so when it hits an A at this point, it's going to stick in a T there because they're floating around. There are T's floating around. Is that OK? Yeah. All four nucleotides have to be there. So it'll just grab one and bring it in. So that part was easy for it to do. It doesn't have to search. OK. Good. Uh-huh. If you mentioned an A or a T, there were invocations on a new graph, which is what about the C and the G or the A? Yeah. So just imagine, there's some sequence here. And the sequence could be GCAT, whatever. And they're all in there, yeah. And then when it hits a G, when it sees a G here, it goes, ah, I have to put in a C. And then, oh, I didn't repeat the question. He says, did you get the question from my answer? So he's saying, what's going on here, basically? What's in this sequence? I don't see a GCAT, that's because I left it out. But there are GCATG, GTT, whatever. And when the polymerase hits the G here, it'll put a C opposite, and then it'll move a little bit forward and stick in another nucleotide and so on. Great. Uh-huh. What is the C that we start breaking and joining as a ring? And does the speed change over H? This speed of the repair or the... The break up under repair and... Oh, oh, oh, how fast does this repair occur? I actually, I don't know. Somebody may know, I don't. That's not a well-defined number. I know for the pathway that I'm interested in, Nanomologus and joining, it's over the span of hours. So, for homologous recombination, my guess is it's probably of that order. So it takes the question was how long does it take to do this repair? It takes a couple hours sometimes. And so there have to be all kinds of signals to tell us to sell, hold it, don't do anything yet. I've got to fix things. How long does it take to make a break? Well, how long does it take to break something? They know the answer. Cosmic rig bang, it's done, right? So it's always easy to break things. Yeah. Yeah. So I think your real question was, how often do the breaks occur in my body? That's your real question. What's the frequency of breaks? It's happening all the time. Yeah. Yeah, it's happening all the time. I'll get it some really hard numbers. It'll really scare you. Uh-huh. Is the repair as vital as the young person is in a way? Is the repair as vital in a young person as it isn't an old person? Well, I'm older, so it's more vital to me. But I think it's equally vital, really. It turns out that if you don't repair things properly, mutations occur. And if you build up enough mutations, you get cancer. And on average, you have to mutate about six very important genes in order to get cancer. And as you age, you sort of build, each one of yourselves builds up a few mutations. And one of them, if one of them happens to get the magical six, it can turn into a cancer cell. So if you look at the incidence of cancer as a function of time, it goes up at the sixth power of age. Whoa. T to the sixth power. That's why old people get cancer and young people don't. But the cancers that young people get are the cancers that only need one hit. So there are a few rare cancers that just need that one hit. But most of the common ones, breast, colon, prostate, cancer, pancreatic cancer, those need, on average, about six hits. Uh-huh. I've related to the other questions. How long can it be broken for this mechanism to still work? How long can the DNA be broken for this mechanism to work? Well, if the DNA is broken and the replication fork gets too far away, then you have to pull in the backup pathway, the non-homologous and joining pathway. That it's non-homologous because it isn't homologous recombination. So we call it non-homologous and joining. But the variables are nonetheless. It'll try to do it. Yeah, it'll detect, it'll see the break. All kinds of signals will go out, broken, right? And then, and then it'll try to bring in all the machinery to repair the break. Lucky for you. Yeah. Now, here's some more machinery. This is going to be important. Later, several proteins promote strand exchange. Remember I told you that in order to have this strand exchange, you have to take a DNA molecule that's already zipped up and somehow unzip it to let that broken piece of DNA squeeze in. Right? Remember that? So what happens is that broken DNA actually, this is one of those things where you take a few steps back in order to go forward. The broken DNA actually gets resected leaving a 3 prime overhang. you actually remove some pretty good material. And then that leaves a single stranded piece of DNA. And that's a single stranded binding protein called RPA replication protein A. And that coats the single stranded DNA. That's really to protect it temporarily. So that just coats it to protect it. And then two proteins, rad 51 and Bricka 2. Brick a 2 might have a familiar ring to it, because Brick a 2 stands for breast cancer 2 gene. So we're very interested in that. Rad 51 stands for radiation, radiation because it was first discovered in yeast. And yeast that were mutated in that gene were especially sensitive to ionizing radiation, which makes double strand breaks. So that's why it's named Rad 51. Now those two proteins make it to this junction between double stranded and single stranded DNA. And what they do is they see this protected piece of single stranded DNA and they load on and they cooperate so that more and more rad 51 molecules get recruited to make a filament on this single stranded DNA. And it is that filament that actually makes this especially good at doing strand invasion to create what we call this deloup. It's called the deloup, because biologists are really cock-eyed, and sometimes they walk around like that. And there's a D there. So these filaments allow that deloup to form. And then, because that's a reaction that doesn't want to happen all by itself. And then now you can copy and repair your break and so on. And then you're free, free and clear. Now it turns out that Brick a 2 is loading rad 51 on. So it's just ushering the rad 51 onto the single strand of DNA. But Brick a 2 has to have some help to get where it needs to go. And guess what? BRCA1 helps Brick a 2 get there. BRCA1 has a familiar ring. It's also involved in breast cancer. And Brick-a-1, God's Brick-a-2, to the DNA end. Some of this we just discovered last year. But it's so neat you have to hear about it. Because it all makes sense now, right? OK. Not me, but they discovered last year. OK. Now, I want to show you a filament, because I promised you molecules to medicine. Here are the filaments. This is what it looks like. The rad 51 molecules are wrapped around the DNA. And now you can see the wrapping. Can you see the wrapping with the lights are shining on me? But I think you should see the wrapping which looks like that wrapping around the DNA. So that's the active ingredient that causes single strand invasion. All right. Now, brick-a-one and brick-a-two mutations cause breast and ovarian cancer. Effective individuals carry one mutant and one normal allele for Brick 1 or Brick 2. So one of their two chromosomes has a mutation. The other one doesn't. But if you get a mutation of the second allele in a breast cell, it disrupts homogs recombination because you can't load rad 51 on anymore. And you can't do the strain invasion. So homogs recombination gets shut down. Now, because you don't do homogs recombination, You don't repair double strand breaks as efficiently as you once did. And as a result, you develop more and more mutations. And it's easier to get those six mutations that you need to become a cancer cell, because you have a repair system that's been knocked out. So women who carry these mutations will get breast cancer in their 20s, instead of in their 50s and 60s. It takes much less time because they've knocked out this repair machinery. You okay with this? Yeah. Alleele, what does the word alleele mean? I should kick myself. That I apologize. Alleele just means that I have two chromosome 6s. chromosome 6, chromosome 6. Therefore, I forget which chromosome Brica BRCA1 is on. There's one gene on this chromosome, BRCA1 gene on this chromosome, and one BRCA1 gene on this chromosome. Those are the two alleles. Alleles are fancy word for saying, I've got two copies of every gene with a few exceptions. We men lack two copies of some very important genes. Women, on the other hand, This may be an explanation for their superiority. Have two copies because they have two X chromosomes. We only have one copy. But except for the X and Y chromosomes, we have two copies of every gene. The unfortunate nature of the fact that we have only one X chromosome means we're susceptible to a lot of diseases because we don't have a backup copy. So that's why that's basically the root cause of our inferiority. On the other hand, that's why we have to subjugate women for centuries in order, you know, but they're getting even now. So on the other hand, we have a Y chromosome. And the Y chromosome is what causes us to become men. So that encodes genes for pro football and things like that. You know, those testosterone-related things. Okay, any other questions? But thank you for a leal. That was very important. Uh-huh. So if somebody gets tested for BRCA1 and 2, see, they already have it in their body, but they don't have the need if they're negative? Oh, yeah. So what does it mean for a woman to be tested for BRCA1 or BRCA2? Right. What it means is that you're gonna look at her normal self You really don't know if she has a breast cancer brewing, right? You're just going to take her normal cells and you're going to see if one of the two alleles has a mutation in either one of those genes. Now those genes are inherited, so that woman got one of those mutant genes from either mom or dad and sister or brother also could be carrying one copy of those mutant genes. Yes. So as a result, if you find one of those mutant genes, it tells you that the process of becoming a breast cancer has been foreshortened and you're at very high risk for getting breast cancer. So if you turn out to be a carrier for a mutation in Brickle 1 or Brickle 2, you either are going to say to yourself, I have to be very careful and have very careful surveillance for breast cancer. Or I might decide to have radical surgery to remove the offending organs, either the breasts and or the ovaries. So I can't get breast or ovarian cancer. So that's a very difficult choice some women have to make. OK. Now, how do you do surveillance? This all comes around, right? How do you do surveillance for breast cancer? What do you use? A mammogram. What does a mammogram use? Ionizing radiation. What do ionizing radiation rays do? They make double strand breaks, which are repaired by the homogenous recombination, which is encoded by Brickle 1 and Brickle 1 and Brickle 2 are involved in. So some of the devices we have, boy, you guys have learned fast. You now realize what a problem we have. So we're sort of on Occam's razor here. So if this is the way all humans repair their cells, what does trust cancer seem to be more prevalent to you? Oh, what a great question. So all the cells repair DNA the same way with this machinery. All of our cells are using this machinery. So how come women get stuck with breast cancer? That seems unfair. Now that question is actually a really deep question. It almost falls into the realm of philosophical discussion. Because the answer is we don't know. We do know that you can get ovarian cancer. So it's not just breast cancer, but then why? Yeah, that's just women too. Why not every other cancer? Why not? We just don't know. We don't really understand. That's all I can tell you. Now it turns out men who have mutations in Brickle 1 or Brickle 2 can sometimes get breast cancer. They can't get ovarian cancer obviously, but they can't get breast cancer. So that does happen. But we really don't know. Why is disruption of this particular DNA repair pathway so important for the breast and relatively less important for other tissues. I know no one knows the answer to that. Uh-huh. Could that be maybe why it's continued now with the white chromosome then that something is actually protecting them from the breast cancer? Um, uh, what's, yeah. The question is, are men being protected from breast cancer? Well, I think we men are being protected from breast cancer because we have a lot less at risk. We don't carry around breasts. And also breast cancers actually are estrogen dependent, and we're not making estrogen. So I think it's not got to do with the Y chromosome. It's got more to do with the fact that we have less breast tissue and we don't have estrogen hanging around that are stimulating the breast cancer cells to divide. But there's enough around so that men who have this mutation can actually get breast cancer. Breast cancer does occur in men. But it's mostly because we don't make estrogen, I think. And we treat breast cancer with anti-estrogens. So all right. Now I'm going to tell you about site-specific recombination. Retroviral integration is one example. And I'm going to tell you that because retroviruses, oh, what's the word retrovirus mean? Retroviruses refers to the fact that these viruses have, don't have DNA in their genome. They have RNA in their genome. And in order to copy their RNA, they actually copy their RNA into DNA, which is kind of backwards. Because usually DNA gets transcribed into RNA to make proteins. So retroviruses do it backwards, so they're called retroviruses. OK, they cause human disease. HIV causes AIDS. You all know that. Hepatitis B, I bet you didn't know was a retrovirus, but it actually goes through an RNA to DNA copying mechanism, and it causes hepatitis and liver cancer. And retrovirus is undergo recombination with the DNA of the human genome. You may not have known that. Retroviruses are hopping into your DNA. So this is what happens. This is the retroviral DNA. It's already copied itself. It started as an RNA molecule, but it made itself into a double-stranded DNA molecule by doing its reverse transcription. And this blue here is the target, the human chromosome. And this viral DNA, the virus carries with it and enzyme called integrase. It's the name integrase stands for its ability to integrate the viral DNA into our genome. So that's why it's called integrase. And it basically attacks us by sticking itself right smack into the middle of our genomes. And basically at random sites. And then from there, it hijacks our machinery to make more virus particles and to move on with its life at our expense. Just an example of site-specific recombination. That is Mr. Potato Head. Except it does it's an unattractive mustache that's being stuck on there. Okay. Uh-huh. The power of the caradron, the machinery for doing that for a reverse transcription. Yes. Yes, they do. It's a special DNA polymerase that instead of copying DNA, the question was, do the retrovirus this carry their own special machinery to accomplish this strange maneuver? And the answer is yes. They carry the enzymes into little Varian particle. Do we have any need for anything like that? anything like that? And is that a site that say a pharmaceutical maker might target? And yeah, and because the retrovirus is somewhat different, he's saying, because it carries its own special enzymes, its integrase, and its own special DNA polymerase, is that something that a pharmaceutical manufacturer would target? And the answer is yes, the first HIV drug that was ever developed was called AZO Thymedine, AZT. And it is a nucleotide, a fake nucleotide that actually fools the retroviral polymerase much more than it fools our polymerase. So that's why it worked. It didn't work. It has side effects because it's not perfect because our polymerase is also used it to some extent. But the other polymerase, the retroviral polymerase likes it much more. So exactly right. If you understand the differences at the molecular level, You could be an entrepreneur just like our friend here who could think of a way to cure AIDS. So that's why we need to know this stuff. Okay. Finally, repair. Okay. That's what fixes DNA. We already talked about one process of repair because it's basically a recombination, it's recombinational repair. I am going to tell you that DNA repair is very important because DNA damage is unavoidable The human genome is 6 billion base pairs, counting all the chromosomes. They're 0.3 for a third of an annometer per base pair. Now, if you multiply 6 billion times a third of an annometer, you get two meters. So every cell in your body has DNA that would basically be more than most of your height. Okay? Now, your body, on the other hand, has 10 to the 13 cells. So you have to multiply two meters times 10 to the 13. That's two times 10 to the 13 meters, which means nothing to you. So I recalculated it in terms of solar system diameters. Fifty solar system diameters of DNA in your little body. And damage in any one part of that can eventually lead to cancer. cancer. That's a lot to protect. So this is very important. And also you want to know because DNA is damaged by many anti-cancer drugs and of course no surprise to you, many anti-cancer drugs can cause something. What do they cause? Cancer. So we take a patient with Hodgkin's disease, treat them with these wonderful drugs and we say you're cured and then five years later they get another cancer sometimes. At a rate of about five percent It's usually leukemia. And so actually I think Phil ended up taking care of them. So I basically gave him my business 5% of the time. So that's a very unfortunate thing. We do need better things than this. Okay. So there are three major classes of DNA damage. Each class has many mechanisms and I don't have time to tell you about all of them. I am only going to tell you about one. And I'm going to tell you about this one because it's going to really scare you. It's called base loss. These bases are attached to the DNA. These are the bases that hold the code. They are the G's, C's, A's and T's. They do all the coding. Okay? Now, these things, believe it or not, fall off. About 5,000 of them fall off of the DNA in a given cell per day. So you have all this DNA. It's pretty long. system diameters. So from that point of view, 5,000 is in the whole lot, but 5,000 is a pretty high number. And so there has to be a repair system to deal with those 5,000, okay? And I'm going to just tell you about that repair system. Because then you'll be really caught up about an article that was published last month in the New England Journal of medicine if you know about this. So, basic decision repair deals with it. See, here's a piece of DNA. Look at that. G-C-T-A-T-C-C. So this is something somewhere in your genome, right? And look at that. All the bases are little colored blocks. And there's one colored block there that's missing. DNA helix with a missing base. 5,000 of those bases fell off that one cell in one day. So that spontaneous loss of a base creates an apurinic or apermedinic site, that's an ap site. Now, the bases fall into two classes. Pureens are permittings. So biologists came up with a fancy name, which is very, it should be just an ap basic site. But I'm going to call an ap site because that's what biologists call it. Just pretend. You can pretend I never said it. but base excision repair restores the loss bases. So there's an AP endonuclease that recognizes that AP site, the site without the base. OK? And it places a nick there. And so you have a DNA helix with a little gap. Now, if you have a DNA helix with a little gap, you know how to repair gaps because you've got a template strand to copy from. And DNA polymerase can come in. and copy. And now opposite this G goes a C. You OK? So this whole course, the whole lecture is starting to come together, right? OK. OK. And now you're repaired. So you're safe. Now, there is a protein called PARP. I'll tell you in a minute what PARP stands for. It binds to the DNA gap to make this process more efficient. You can imagine that you noticed in Brickle 1 and Brickle 2, you had a protein that did the job, but then you had another protein to help it do it faster. That's because this stuff is so important. You got to go top-chop as fast as possible. So PARP accelerates this, and this has got to go really fast, because this is happening at the rate of 5,000 per day. Now, double strand breaks. Only you're only getting a few in yourself per day. but this is several thousand per day. Okay, so what's PARP? PARP recruits repair proteins to the DNA single strand breaks and it stands for poly ADP ribose polymerase. ADP is like the brother of ATP, that's the energy molecule. Well, it turns out, AADP isn't just for energy. What it can do is it can be constructed to make big polymers of itself. So the part actually binds to the DNA gap, and then it becomes activated, and then it attaches it ADP ribose polymers to itself and to other proteins. It makes a cloud of ADP polymers. And we don't exactly know why it's doing this, but we do know that its ability to do this is very important for recruiting the DNA polymerase and ligase to the single strand break to do the repair. So think of it as slime. These ADP polymers are just sort of hanging out there. They're very unstructured. And I think what's going on is it's like Velcro, just or slime, just stuck out there. So that these very important enzymes find their way there and do the job very quickly. OK? I mainly had to tell you about that so you knew what part meant. But it's kind of cool anyway. Now, homologous recombination saves part one deficient cells. People were trying to figure out what part one did, so they made what's called a knockout mouse. You can do genetics on a mouse and take a gene and wipe it out and say, if I wipe out both copies or both alleles of the part one gene, just make it totally part one deficient what happens to the mouse. It turned out the mouse was perfectly healthy. So I didn't pay attention to the part literature. I said to myself, how important could it be? A mouse can live just fine without it. And then some important things started to happen. I started having to learn about it. But it turns out that the reason the part one mouse is perfectly happy is because homologous recombination is a backup for part deficiency. So now we're going back to the replication fork. See? It's only bigger now. And suppose I have defective base excision repair. There's a gap there that isn't going to get filled very quickly because I've got a parpe deficient mouse for example. Look at this replication fork. It's moving to your right. It's headed right for there. So these are railroad tracks. And one of the two tracks has a gap. And this is the train. This is a big machine here, which is like a locomotive going to the right very quickly. So what happens? The migration of the replication fork converts the single strand break into a double strand break. See? Now, if this break is here, now if I start and do lagging synthesis, I can't copy this thing, right? There's going to be a gap. Polon arrays can't copy over across the gap. But since this is a new replicate, this is newly synthesized DNA, this is exactly the scenario for which homologous recombination was designed. Because you have a double strain break here, you can do homologous recombination on the other strand, all right, to repair Remember homoax recombination? Where we had the deloop and then we copied the missing material and then we restored the DNA and then we're fine. So that's why the PARP deficient mouse was perfectly fine. PARP deficient mouse was okay not because PARP was not important but because PARP is so important there's a backup system. stupid me. I should have realized. Right? How could such a cool enzyme that was doing such cool things not be important? It was because it was so important. Are you okay with me on this? This is pretty hard. Okay. I'm going to have to give you a break soon. So homologous recombination repairs the double strand break. Now here's the kicker. This is why you want to learn about this. People have developed drugs that inhibit Part 1, and it turns out they kill Brick 1 and Brick 2 breast cancer cells. July 9, 2009. Whoa. Now you can imagine Part 1 inhibitors. How about Part 1 inhibitor? Now Brick 1 and Brick 2 breast cancer is only 4% of all breast cancers. What about the other 95%? What if I treated them with Parpe1 inhibitors? What do you think would happen? I don't hear. Nothing, remember the Parpe1 deficient mouse? Perfectly happy because he had homologous recombination. Actually she had homologous recombination. So the other breast cancers, this isn't gonna help, right? But for the 5% of breast cancers that have homologous recombination knocked out, this is going to be really great. Well, let's drug have side effects. Well it could, it could, but it works only when Bricka 1 is knocked out completely, both alleles, both copies of Bricka 1 are knocked out. Then you don't have homologous recombination. of a cell has one copy knocked out and one copy good. That cell still does homologous recombination. So you've got a drug that knocks off the cancer cell where both copies are knocked out. But for a normal cell where one of the two copies is still good, it's not going to be very harsh. Yes? So, if somebody takes this drug, what's happening to that person's repair while the drug is being taken? And the answer is, if you took that drug, you would be back here. And all your normal cells would have little gaps in them in their DNA, right? But not to worry, your normal cells do homogenous recombination, and your normal cells would repair that when the replication fork moves forward, right? And then it repairs that break. So you're taking it and you are shutting down basic decision repair, but lucky for you, you've got homologous recombination. Even if you happen to be, I don't know what your Genotype is, but even if you happen to be Brick-a-1 or Brick-a-2 Mutant, you've got one normal copy and that's enough to make homologous recombination go. So that's a great question. That's asking the question about side effects a different way. That's a really cool basic science result. That's a really cool basic science result. Right, so now you've got maybe some present with some PowerPoint inhibitor that they used to do the study. But you know, suppose somebody says, okay, well let's move down the road to make this into the treatment. Yes. What kind of timeframe? Oh, no, it's about to get approved by the FDA. This drug, this is, oh, let me show you. And something gets into here, this is called the New England Journal of Medicine. This was a clinical trial where they treated women with breast cancer. This is coming very soon. I don't know if it's, does anybody know if it's FDA approved already? This was a phase two trial that was reported. A triple negative, it was affected with triple negative breast cancer. And a company just acquired 500 million dollars for this company. That's cheap. Yeah, this is. So anyway, this is going to be approved very quickly, because in the phase two trial, the women who got treated had hardly any side effects. So how long ago did we know the science? How long did it take to get to this point? You know, I was ignoring part literature. I'm a DNA repair guy, and I was ignoring it. But there were people working on it. I think we knew about PARP, and basic decision repair, maybe five or ten years ago, it's been kind of purking along for the last ten years. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, we didn't fully realize what was going on for a while. And some of this machinery was getting put together from different angles. People were studying homologous recombination, other people were studying basic decision repair. So, and all of it came together. I think this is beautiful. And I think the reason I need to tell you this is, you just saw how the three are, is come together to make a drug that has no side effects that can take these very unfortunate women with a terrible cancer and treat it all about, you know, that's pretty good. So what company should we buy stockings? I forget. I forget. I actually do forget. But you could look it up. No, you could look it up because these slides will be online and all you have to do is do part one or you could do New England Journal of Medicine July 9, 2009 at part one and on Google it and you'll get the article instantly. Okay? Yeah, it's too late to buy the stock obviously. Okay, applications, recombinant DNA and new drugs. Do you want a five minute break? Right. Anyway, no, I'm wearing a Foley catheter, so I... Not really. But if somebody... Okay, a lot of women were saying no, but you know, some of the men might want to go. If anybody... If you want to go, I won't be hurt. Where are the bathrooms? Up here to the right or left, just outside. So if you want to go, I won't be hurt. Uh-huh. It'll be good. It'll be fine. I always give the medical students a break after 50 minutes. And then if one of my co-lecturers don't give a break, I go in and yell at them. OK. So we're going to do applications. Recombinate DNA and new drugs. OK. So history, I showed you Arthur Cormburg 1957, 1973, the invention of recombinant DNA. And I'm showing you these characters because you might bump into one of them if you're on campus here. This is Stan Cohen, who has a lab just across campus drive in the main, right? Two floors above Dean Pizzo. OK, so he's still there. Stan Falco. He's emeritus now, but I see him on campus all the time. Herb Boyer, I don't see him because he was at UCSF and Genentex Herb Boyer. He left UCSF for Genentex, the boom in genetic engineering, Prince Charles, picks a bride. So this gives you a time frame for where we were. And Paul Berg still comes to work every day. So you might bump into him. This is the Beckman Center right across the way. So these three guys with the red arrows had a midnight brainstorming session at a scientific meeting at around midnight, and they were hungry, and they were looking for corn beef. So they found on Maui, a New York-style deli, and they started talking about plasma DNA. These are little bits of DNA that bacteria have in them that actually carry antibiotic resistance, for example. And they had a brainstorming session where they thought, we could maybe use these plasmids, which are the bane of antibiotics, and manipulate them to do some good for ourselves, make them into a tool. So they started having ideas about that. Paul Bergman, while was working hard at Stanford, not on Maui, doing experiments with the SV40 virus, and in building M, which is also at the time, one floor above Dean Pizzo's office. And what happened was they came up with the idea of recombinant DNA. And so the outcome was, Stan and Herb patented the idea. That turned out to be the biggest patent that Stanford and UCSF I think, ever the most lucrative patent they ever had. So Stanford and Stan and Herb also shared in the wealth. Paul won the Nobel Prize. And, you know, someone had to pay for the dinner on Maui. Stan paid for the dinner on Maui. So I'll tell you an interesting story. When I was a first appointed to be a professor here, they had this idea that they would hook us up with a senior faculty member who could be our mentor. And I was really lucky. I got to sign Stan. And so Stan took me out to lunch, and I asked him if he would please pick up the check. I can't remember what happened, but it didn't work. So anyway, he actually, in many ways, deserves one of those. independently of, and so the last girl award was actually recently awarded to him, and the last girl award is designed to try to make up for oversights that Stockholm had. But you know, and Stockholm can always make up, make up for the problem because Stan has done so many other things that they made choose to recognize him anyway for other things that he's done. Anyway, so that's that story. The other part of the story is, these are congressional hearings because people fear what recombinant DNA could do. They feared that some bioteric could create an organism that could wipe out the world. And so what ended up happening was Paul was the leader in recombinant DNA and Paul decided that it was be a politically good thing if scientists put a halt on their own research before Congress got into the act. Because one thing you don't want Congress to do is to try to figure out how to regulate something. So Paul called a conference at a silamar down the coast near Monterey, and all of the leaders in this field decided that they would have a self-imposed moratorium until they could figure out what would be safe. OK? And then Congress didn't have to act because everything came to a halt. And since Paul was ahead of the game, the fact that he was stopping meant that everybody else felt that they had to stop, too. And so we actually emerged from that with the ability to make recombinant DNA molecules, and you've never heard of an accident and so on and so forth. So things have come out OK. So in 1973, invention of recombinant DNA. And what you do is you open a plasmid, which is circular piece of DNA, and you take into it, And you put into it, insert into it a foreign DNA molecule, say for something you want to make, say, growth hormone, which is one of the first things that Genentech wanted to make. And what you do is you can make now this DNA by polymerase chain reaction, which is basically replication in a test tube. And then you introduce the recombinant DNA into cells. And the construction of this recombinant DNA is just DNA recombination in a test tube. So I taught you all about that, so you could do this. So now you could make some of your favorite protein, which could be a drug. Now, you might be interested in growth hormone, if you have a child who's very small. But you can also make some very important growth factors. One is called EPO or Ritropolitan. And it's a growth factor for red blood cell precursors. And it stimulates the production of red cells. And the way it does that is I'm showing you a molecule of EPO in red here. And it binds to what's called the EPO receptor on the surface of cells in the bone marrow. And these cells in the bone marrow put together this receptor as a dimer. So there are two subunits that are the same as each other. And EPO binds in this pocket here. And the cell gets the signal, aha, it's time for me to divide. That's a red cell precursor, and it starts dividing and making more young red cells to go out into the circulation to help us breathe. Okay? Very neat. Now the reason this is important is, Epo is made by our kidneys. And so who are the people who are going to get anemic? Who do you think? People who have cancer I heard, but since it's made in the kidneys, who else? Dialysis patients. or anybody with kidney disease, whose kidneys aren't working, exactly. And so the good of this is, it treats the anemia associated with either renal failure, patient-signed dialysis, or with cancer chemotherapy. And it replaces transfusion, which often takes a few hours with a single intramuscular injection. Boom, it's in there. Okay. The problem, of course, is it takes two weeks to work for the red cells to emerge out of the bone marrow. But it's very convenient and very quick instead of a transfusion. It conserves the supply of donated blood. And this is a really big problem. Because in the Bay Area especially, there's a shortage of blood. But the Bay Area imports blood from the rest of the country. So we get blood from the rest of the country to make up for our shortage. And it eliminates the risk of blood-borne diseases. So we do have a shortage of donated blood, especially here. in the Midwest it isn't as bad. They seem to have different values there. It isn't because of HIV by the way. The incidence of HIV in the Bay Area, of course, you know is only gonna be a few percent, right? So it's mostly because people don't have time to donate. So my wife and I donated three of the 10 units of blood, the blood bank, Stanford blood bank, collected this weekend. So, so those are the guys here, you could actually donate two units, which I just did, which is kind of fun. You can go swimming and see what happens, things like that. So that's an advertisement for donating blood if you think you're eligible, because there really is a short, it's very sad to go in there. Because when I offered two units, they were getting close to closing, but they said, We'll take you. And I discovered it's because up to that point, they had only collected seven units. And it was the end of the day. So that was it. So the bad is that that picture of Epo that I showed you is part of this advertisement. That might be Optimus Prime. I don't know. So. And Epo is really good for the tour de France and other athletic pursuits. And the reason it's good is it is a recombinant human Epo. It has precisely the same protein amino acid sequence as human Epo. It's very hard to detect. It's a mimic of the human protein. So you can actually give yourself a shot of Epo and raise your hematocrit so that you now can carry oxygen much better to your muscles and become a better cyclist. And get away with it. So that's the bad and the ugly of it. Okay. Now I'm going to tell you some more things that are even uglier because this is really ugly as far as I'm concerned. This is one of the most shameful things on the planet right now. It's just as shameful as people starving in other parts of the world because this is a country that's actually wealthy enough to take care of its own citizens. So the view from below the clinic, I'm going to give you two examples of how spending more money can lead to a worse outcome. Because one of the things you've heard about is how are we going to ensure, all the uninsured? How can we afford to do it? And I'm going to show you two examples that amount to billions of dollars or we ended up spending billions of dollars to get worse outcomes. And so this gives me hope. I mean, this was shameful that we did it, but it gives me great hope that if we structure the healthcare reform properly, now we're getting into things I think you're really interested in, we will be able to give better healthcare to everybody for less money. How much less about twofold less? I'll show you why. Okay, so from the ground, pharma educates patients. This is an ad that they give to patients. Are you ready to start chemotherapy? Low white cell blood counts. How new last is? New last is another growth factor just like EPO and it stimulates the production of white cells. Help protect against infections. Questions to ask your doctor? The question is, hey doctor, can I have new last up? The reason they're advertising is because it costs $2,500 for each injection. So the company makes a lot of money. Every time we prescribe this, that's a lot of money. That's the administration fee. Now, I'm being a little unfair. That's the administration fee if you don't have insurance. If you do have insurance like Blue Cross, they've negotiated the price downward to $6,500. It's a lot of money. So the hospital loves us oncologists. Medicare actually, a Medicare only pays a little bit more than that. So doctors don't like Medicare. That's why the AMA is so scared that a public option would be just like Medicare. In fact, I think the public option just died today. It is instead of... Huh. OK. They'll come back. So... You're looking at it and you're going to be talking about... Yeah. So it may come back. They're going to give it another try. I don't know. Anyway, I don't really care what option they have as long as they design it properly. I'm definitely afraid they won't, because too many of the wrong people are lining up behind this with too much enthusiasm. and they have a lot of money to make. I wish they were a little bit more, some of the big industries are really love what's happening now. So this is a long-acting, erythropoan, same company, same kind of advertising. Amgen makes epegin an aronest. Johnson and Johnson makes pro-credin e-pricks. They divided the market. Amgen does the cancer patients. Johnson and Johnson does the dialysis patients. 2004 sales of EPO, $8.6 billion. Now, MGen stock, this isn't a real graph. It goes from 70 to 50. It doesn't go to zero. But the price of US dollars in January was here. And then in the course of a couple months, dropped precipitously. Something happened. What happened? What happened? What's called the DeHankatan trial, November 2006, just before the stock drop. It was prematurely terminated. What was it? It was to determine if RNA improves the outcome and head net cancer patients who are treated with radiotherapy. The reason for doing this trial was there were theoretical reasons for thinking that it might help, because cancer cells when they're hypoxic, when they don't get enough oxygen are actually resistant to radiotherapy. They don't die as easily. So they had a good theoretical idea. If the cancer cells get enough oxygen, they'll die more readily from radiotherapy. So the reason the company was really interested is there was a good theoretical idea. But what they were going to do is they're going to treat patients with hemoglobin less than 14. Now 14 is a really high number. So they were going to get the hematocrit up there to where the cyclists want to be. If you go to the blood bank, they'll take you if your hemoglobin is 12.5 or above and they'll take blood out of you. So 14 is really high, okay? The result, five year disease-free survival was worse on airness than the control. Whoa, P equal 0.02, Journal of Clinical Oncology, 15S supplement. That was a supplement because it's only an abstract. hasn't been published yet, but it was reported at the American Society for Clinical Oncology Meeting last June. Let me show you. Now, that was last June. So at 2006, okay? The report came out last June, 2009. Look at this date, 2003. They were selling Epo right along, 2003, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, all the way right through. This is a paper published in Lancet, not an invisible journal at all. It is up there with the New England Journal of Medicine in prestige. This is a Kaplan-Mire Survival Curve. This is months, time and months. This axis is what's called progression-free survival. At the beginning of the trial, 100% of the patients have not progressed yet by definition. But as time goes on, the cancer starts to progress. So as the curve goes downward, that means you're losing more and more patients because the cancer has progressed. So the lower the curve, the worse you are. So as time goes on, more and more patients get picked off by the cancer. Now there are two curves here. One is a placebo control where you just give sort of normal sailing. Boom, just inject normal sailing. Those patients aren't doing great. Head and neck cancer is a very bad cancer. So after 24 months actually, only 40% of them are still cancer free. It gave some patients Epo and look where that is. The curve is below. Costs 13,000 shot dollars a shot. With insurance, Blue Cross maybe 6,500. There's a lot of money. $8.6 billion going into this. I think we, oncologists, were spending more than the dialysis doctors. What's going on there? I told you, there is this receptor called the epal receptor that when it's stimulated causes the red cell precursors to grow. Now when you name something, you usually name it because that's how you discovered it. It's called the epal receptor because it was found on red cells. There was no law that said cancer cells couldn't have epal receptors. And indeed cancer cells do have epal receptors. They have two kinds. normal Epo receptor on the surface of red cells, and they have a heterodimeric Epo receptor as well. Not all cancer cells have this, but many of them do. And those cancer cells that have these receptors will respond to Epo by growing. So, that's what that diagram means. And we were doing this for years, even after we knew about this. It's disgraceful, 8.6 billion a year. So is that sudden, is that sudden done? Is that the report done? Is it showing to a study on hidden net cancer? Yeah, this is head net cancer. But the company reported the FDA. This was published in Lancet, it was reported to the world. Right, but is the company having an obligation to report that? Well, the FDA knew about it. Is the indication for the drug head net cancer? Yes. Yes, one of the indications for this drug is the Neumia of chemotherapy. Was that your question? Yeah. But it wasn't. But the drug wasn't being administered. It was being administered to head and neck cancer patients. It was. How did it happen? OK, write your congressman. We have a dysfunctional FDA as the answer. The question was, how did that happen? The answer is we have a dysfunctional FDA. Uh-huh. That's my opinion. I think we want to stop that propagate out into on-touching. I mean, so if something comes out, we'll answer. The deserved down to read this, you know, if you're practicing and telling the stories. I haven't been giving Epo for years. So let me tell you why some people were giving Epo. The company, you know, was engaged in a scientific discussion. Maybe this result is real. Maybe it isn't real. Maybe there are reasons for this result. Maybe there are shortcomings in the study. Maybe you're not right. But let me tell you, a lot of people in private practice were giving Epo even when it probably wasn't the best thing to do. When the patient really wasn't that anemic, why do you think they would do that? Well, the patient was getting tired and chemotherapy is tough. And they said, well, maybe I'll give you some info because maybe it'll help you feel better and know by the way. So there's a huge conflict of interest among physicians. And so one of the problems with medical care here is our system is based on fee for service. And this is how fee for service can be a problem. But I'm preaching now. Let's face it, I'm editorializing. How would the public option expect? How would the public option fix that? Let's wait, let's wait, let's stick with questions until the end because I want to give you enough time to ask questions. But we can talk about how would I fix the whole system, but you know, that's philosophical. Yeah. If the drug cost $2.5 dollars for a shot and then looks a Stanford charge is $13,000, how much of that difference goes for the doctor or? Oh to me, nothing. Because I happen to be on salary here. But not on a salary. Huh? I am a salary physician. Oh, private practice. No one private practice you're running a private practice. So that goes to support your practice. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can talk about those things later. I'm going to give you a short history of Viax. You all heard about it. Fewer gastrointestinal side effects published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2000. Between 1999 and 2003, there were eight trials with independent endpoint committees that showed an almost four-fold increase in heart attack risk of viox versus naproxan. It turns out there were eight trials without independent endpoint committees, and it turned out vox was actually protective. All of these trials were sponsored by Merck. But the independent endpoint committees can't have Merck employees on them. 2004, viox was withdrawn. If you wanna look it up, in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007. The Victor trial was to see if viox improved outcome in colon cancer patients because it turns out that there was some data that suggested viox would prevent colon cancer because aspirin does. And aspirin probably does so through the receptor that viox works on, something called the COX2 receptor. Okay? So this trial had a good scientific basis to it, But the problem was that in the background, these heart attacks were going on. So I'm going to run real fast through this. There's viax biology that actually predicted the problem. There's the Cox-2 enzyme here that actually stimulates inflammation. This is what you want to stop. But in addition to that, there's an arm of this pathway which goes through the Cox-1 enzyme, that does very important things for platelets to make blood clots and protects the stomach, okay, from ulcers. Aspirin and Naperson block both pathways. So what you do is you get relief from arthritis, but you also have stomach problems. So what Merck did was they had the V-Best Drug for knocking out Cox-2 and leaving Cox-1 alone, went alone so you could protect the stomach. That paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in the year 2000 was trumpeting their success in protecting the stomach. It was wonderful. And in fact, I think Vox, if we only had it now, we really ought to have it. Because there are people with arthritis who simply can't take anything like this because they have too many stomach problems. But the problem is, this was a very profitable drug and they marketed it to everybody. even people without stomach problems. They also found out that this arm of the pathway stimulates grossly polyps in the colon. Therefore, if you knocked it out, you could prevent colon cancer from recurring, for example, or maybe even have it as a preventive. So if it were a colon cancer preventive, everybody over 50 would be taking it. Who knows how much money that would be. So that's why they liked that trial. It really had an upside. But the problem is it could also affect this arm of the pathway. And remember, it could end up disrupting the clotting mechanism so that you could have unwanted clots in the blood vessels of the heart. And this is something they did know about. And when they designed the first trial that was published in the UN Journal of 2000, they specifically excluded people with a risk for heart attack. But that's OK, as long as they market it to people without a risk for heart attack. But that's not how it happened. So the number of people who died in Vietnam was 58,000, just to give you a rough idea. So has pharma biased the literature? Yeah. 26% of all the papers in the New England Journal of Medicine are written by ghost writers. Somebody not listed as an author wrote the paper. And I can tell you that if a scientist has an article in the New and Journal of Medicine, they can't afford to hire a ghost rider. It's probably, and I know that almost all of the pharmaceutical industry-sponsored papers are written by ghost riders. I've talked to a ghost rider about this. Randomize myeloma trials. This is a fatal disease. And when you do a randomized trial, one arm gets the best possible treatment that's known today, and the other arm gets the experimental treatment. Normally, you would expect experiments like that. If you really don't understand, if you don't know what the outcome is, you would expect them to favor the new treatment about half the time. When these trials, myeloma trials, were not sponsored by industry, it came out in favor of the new drug about what you would expect, about half the time. When they were sponsored by industry, They came out in favor of the new industry drug, 74, three quarters of the time. So I think the literature is biased. What about oncologists? Where do they fit? This was our convention center, Orange County Convention Center in Orlando. Stop by the booth, 3, 3, 2, 4. And down here, this is what I got in my email from Cam Stark. I think those are $100 bills. Benjamin Franklin, who's he? 50? 100. Fistful. They send that to us. And I responded. I took it and put it in my talk. But you know, other. Hydrogen prices yield high administration fees for oncologists. So these are pleased to announce a practice enhancement service line. service line. Practice enhancement. Well in case you don't know. Former editors of the New England Journal of Medicine are really angry. The truth about the drug companies on the take. Easy to see why they have books like that. Uh-huh. Why do they have to? Yeah. Yeah. Why do, the question is, how do we get away with charging these high administration fees? These things are just a shot. How difficult is that? Boom, right in the arm. I don't know. Why do the insurance companies decide how much to pay? It's complicated. But you know, it's got to change. It has to change. I think it really needs to change. So the view from above, I'm going to go through real fast. This is the whole outcome. This is California. This is a graph of annual Medicare spending per beneficiary. This is overall quality ranking. This is where we are. You can see the line actually gets worse the more you spend. Now on the one hand, that's disgusting, but on the other hand, you can understand why I'm so optimistic. Because if we spend less, we'll get better outcomes. Okay, this is healthcare spending in the US as a fraction of GDP. So the GDP is growing and we are spending more. But we're outpacing GDP. Back in 65, we were 6% of GDP. We are now about 17 or 18% because the rest of the economy collapsed and we're headed towards 20%. Well, it can only go so far. Okay, this is a graph. The richer a country is, the more it spends on healthcare. That makes sense. We want our citizens to be healthier. But, so we've got Turkey, Poland, Mexico down here, GDP per capita. This is healthcare expenditure per capita. There's the US. Even when counting for the fact that we're one of the richest countries, we are about 2x over the line. What about quality of care? This is a double graph. The red dots are per capita spending. This is where we are in terms of spending. The red dots and all these other... Now these countries include Japan, Sweden, but they also include... Look at this. Costa Rica, Cuba, Chile. Look who's down there with Costa Rica and Cuba. Tied in life expectancy. In WHO rankings, I think we're... I think we're right there with Costa Rica and Cuba as well. In WHO, rankings of quality of care, not just in average life expectancy. So how can we fix the cost problem? This is the pie. Drug costs are rising fastest of all, but physicians earn money for treatment, not prevention. And hospitals succeed when patients fill their beds. So I have mixed feelings about expanding the hospital, I think the ideal system we should be hoping that the hospital shrinks. So... That used to say five cents, but... Anyway. For five cents. Yeah. I think I went on a little too long, but we... So, we've expected to stay at the molecular level, but we've gone way up to dealing with the healthcare system and I think as Gil knows, we share many of the same views about this and I think this is an extraordinary time that we're facing today for all the reasons that were articulated. So because we still have just a couple of minutes, let's see if we have any questions that relate to any of the topics that have come up so far. The question is, can you access the shots that I found in my presentation on the web? Yeah, I found those all on the web and I'm going to send my PowerPoint presentation so that if you want to look at them, you can. And also, you should be able to find them by doing a Google search. So we're going to be posting. Yeah, I'm going to post a whole slideshow on the web. So offer, now, and subsequent presentations. We'll be posting them online. OK? Yeah. So we're talking about the repair bar. Yes. Specifically with the virus that fence to sell and changes to DNA. Oh, when the retrovirus infects the cell and integrates itself into our DNA. So now you have millions of these cells infected. How does the body be sure that it definitely is the cell? Sorry, that cell is done for. Yeah, because what happened is the question was, what happens when a retrovirus invades one of our lymphocytes that part of our immune system? That's what HIV does. It invades our immune cells. That cell now has a copy of the retrovirus in its genome. Well, if only going to recognize that DNA, that cell is going to look at that DNA and say, that's mine. So the retrovirus is so clever. So let me just tie this back for a second, because I know we're going to be running out of time shortly. So I think that what you've heard from Dr. Gil is really the extraordinary story of not only how DNA works, but how this whole process of recombination takes place. And I think the illustration that you gave about how that in some ways relate to the whole recombinant DNA technology was an extraordinary one. And that actually is what spawned most of biotechnology here in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. But he also told the other side of that story, which was great discoveries can also be greatly abused. and it really does depend upon whether or not we match utilization to need. And sadly, that is where our system is really out of whack. So we're a nation that has, by far, the greatest bioscience discovery engine in the world today. And as you've heard, and I stated last week, and we'll continue to reiterate in other settings, we spend more on health care than any other nation the world with nothing to show in the population basis other than that we're number one in administrative overhead. And you've heard some of the reasons for that tonight. So I think we've had a rich, exciting discussion tonight. I hope you've enjoyed it. Next week, I will actually be missing because I'm giving testimony to a congressional committee on healthcare reform. I've been back to Washington many times over the last several months. It's hard to know where things are heading as it stands, but I think with the Senate Finance Committee's decision today, I doubt the one to hear from me next week, but we'll do our best. But next week will be an opportunity for regeneration. Jill Helms will be speaking about STEM cells and regeneration so please come back and we'll look forward to your comments and questions. Thank you for being here tonight. For more please visit us at stanford.edu.
