## About

**Purpose:** to provide  an  abstract  or  a  shorter  version of the  input  audio file,  as  well as to provide a functional  answer  to  questions  about  this  input  file  using the built-in database

**Tasks:** 
●  Transcribing an audio file 
●  Summarizing  transcription  and  searching for answers  based  on  it  
●  Creating an internal  database 
●  Testing the results obtained  
●  Development of telegram  bots  for visualization 

**Relevance:** the developed  neural  network  can  significantly  simplify  students' lives by saving  time  on  writing  lecture notes and  answering  the  remaining  questions  on the topic

## Usage

Example with lecture audio file:
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/gennadiymarin/hse-vk_llm/blob/main/short_audio/1.png" alt="drawing" width="450"/> 
<img src="https://github.com/gennadiymarin/hse-vk_llm/blob/main/short_audio/2.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
</p>

To check created summary check files in short_audio folder. Additionally, was conducted an experiment with a 90-minute audio file (the duration of the usual lecture), those results check in folder long_audio summary_short.pdf, summary_tuned.pdf for summary results.
